                <h2 class="h5">'We Just 'Need To Record It Properly'</h2>

                    <img src="images/richie.jpeg" alt="Richie Faulkner" class="imgArticle">
                    <p>In a new interview with Keefy of Ghost Cult, JUDAS PRIEST guitarist Richie Faulkner spoke about the progress of the songwriting sessions for the band's follow-up to 2018's "Firepower" album. He said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): "We're in the process of putting it together. Obviously, that process has been stalled somewhat due to COVID the last couple of years. Now that [the COVID restrictions] have been lifted, we're now on a touring cycle. So now there's that challenge to deal with in terms of putting the record together. But we're gonna try to work around it. In between tour legs, we're gonna try to get the stuff recorded.</p>
                    <p>"Rob [Halford, PRIEST singer] always says, 'It'll be done when it's done; it's finished when it's finished.' At this stage of their career, there's no point in rushing anything. It'll be done when it's done. And I think that's the best way of putting it. We'll try to get it done as we can, and you guys will be the first to know when it is."</p>
                    <p> According to Faulkner, the new PRIEST album is already written. "It's kind of in demo form," he explained. "We've got a batch of songs in demo form that are ready to be recorded properly, and we've got the drums done. Everything else needs to be done, really. So in terms of being written, it's written, but we need to record it properly and everything like that. So it's not really anywhere near done. But when it's done, it's done."</p>
                    <p>This past February, Halford was asked by Remy Maxwell of Audacy Check In if he agreed with Faulkner's recent comment that the band's upcoming album will be more musically "progressive" than "Firepower". He responded: "Yeah, the metal is there. But here's the thing: we've tried our best not to replicate anything that we've done. From 'Rocka Rolla' all the way through to 'Firepower', each record has had a distinctive character. And it's tough because fans go, 'We want another 'Painkiller',' 'We want another 'British Steel'.' And [it's, like], 'Dude, we've already done that.'</p>                          
                    <p>"Fans know that we're a band that is always full of adventure and trying new stuff," he continued. "And so, yeah, this has got probably some more progressive elements that we've never really delved into before. And that's exciting, because, again, it gives us and our fans another opportunity to see a different side of PRIEST. But it's still metal. There's just more of it. There are more notes than there were before."</p>
                    <p>Also in February, Faulkner told Canada's The Metal Voice about the overall sound of the new PRIEST music: "Whenever you start a record, you never know how it's gonna turn out. So you might start with an idea of what it's gonna be, and as it kind of rolls on, it comes out something different. So you don't quite know. And also it's really hard to sum up your own music, I find, without sounding really pretentious. But I think this one — it's not 'Firepower 2', I don't think. It's its own thing, it's its own animal. If anything, I would say it's a bit more progressive in places, and in places it's got a bit more of that 'Killing Machine' swagger."</p>
                    <p>Faulkner added: "I know everyone says, 'Oh, is it the next 'Painkiller'?' or 'Is it the next…?' whatever… I don't know if they'd ever done it, but I know we've never done it when I've been in the band; we've never tried to recreate an album. It's always we try to create an album that stands on its own legs. So I think it's definitely a little bit more progressive than 'Firepower' and, as I said, in places it's got a little bit of that 'Killing Machine' angry swagger attitude going on. But again, as I said, we're waiting to see what it turns out like, 'cause it could turn out completely different."</p>
                    <p>A year ago, Halford confirmed that PRIEST's next album will see the band reuniting with the "Firepower" production team consisting of Andy Sneap, longtime collaborator Tom Allom and engineer Mike Exeter (BLACK SABBATH).</p>
                    <p>Bassist Ian Hill is the sole remaining original member of PRIEST, which formed in 1969. Halford joined the group in 1973 and guitarist Glenn Tipton signed on in 1974. Rob left PRIEST in the early 1990s to form his own band, then came back to PRIEST in 2003. Founding guitarist K.K. Downing parted ways with the band in 2011, and was replaced by Faulkner.</p>
                    <p>Tipton was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago after being stricken by the condition at least half a decade earlier. Tipton announced in early 2018 he was going to sit out touring activities in support of "Firepower". He was replaced by Sneap, who is also known for his work in NWOBHM revivalists HELL and cult thrash outfit SABBAT.</p>
                    <p>Faulkner suffered an acute cardiac aortic dissection during the band's performance at the Louder Than Life festival in late September. He was was rushed to the UofL Health - Jewish Hospital where the cardiothoracic surgery team needed approximately 10 hours to complete a life-saving surgery.</p>

                <h1><strong>JUDAS PRIEST's ROB HALFORD Opens Up About His Cancer Battle:</strong></h1>
                <h2 class="h5">'I Should Have Listened To My Doctors'</h2>

                    <p>During an appearance on the latest episode of Full Metal Jackie's nationally syndicated radio show, JUDAS PRIEST singer Rob Halford spoke about his decision to go public with his battle with prostate cancer. Asked if it is correct to say that he is currently in remission, meaning that cancer is responding to treatment or is under control, Halford said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): "Yes, I am." He then added: "Guys and girls, you've gotta look after yourself. You've gotta keep this temple, you've gotta keep the heavy metal temple clean and ready to deal with whatever comes your way. And one of them, for me, was my prostate cancer issue.</p>
                    <p>"Let me quickly tell you: I should have listened to my doctors, because my doctors were saying, 'Hey, this PSA [prostate-specific antigen] level is a bit high.' [And I said,] 'I've gotta do a tour. I'll do it when I come back,'" he continued. "So I missed a couple of opportunities whereby if I had had the treatment earlier, the treatment wouldn't have been as difficult as it was. But, hey, we got through it. I had a wonderful team of medical people that looked after me in Phoenix [Arizona, where I live].</p>
                    <p> "It happened while we were in the full-on pandemic," Halford explained. "So I was in the valley having the prostate removed and then [laughs] two weeks of the catheter, and then [laughs], of course, a little bit of radiation, a couple of months of radiation. But I came through it [thanks to] these beautiful, incredibly talented people. And I'm in remission. But I will throw this out — guys, get your blood test done, get the checks done. We're going through colorectal cancer month right now [in March]. So please look after yourselves. It's so important. Onward and upward."</p>
                    <p>Rob also talked about his decision to mention his cancer battle in the new chapter added to the updated paperback edition of "Confess".</p>                     
                    <p>"I think it was important [to talk about it], because for everybody it's incredibly scary," he said. "The first thing my guy doctor told me, he goes, 'You've got cancer. I'm gonna take your prostate out. Come with me to this other room.' And my world starts really... 'Oh my god. I've got cancer...' I think that's a very natural reaction. And he goes, 'Have you got a question?' I go, 'Am I going to die?' He goes, 'No, you're not going to die. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this.' They're so positive and they're so reinforcing yourself through those early few days of understanding your condition.</p>
                    <p>"And I'll tell you something, as I said in the book, I felt so terribly selfish, because [I thought], 'Oh God, I've got cancer. I've got cancer.' And then I see these commercials for Phoenix children's hospital and these little kids — little kids — with cancer fighting for their lives. And I go, 'For God's sake, you got so far in your life and you've got this to deal with and you've got the most incredibly talented people to look after you and make you well.'</p>
                    <p>Faulkner added: "I know everyone says, 'Oh, is it the next 'Painkiller'?' or 'Is it "So it was a readjustment for me," Rob said. "I was really, really ashamed of myself to have that kind of perspective. But I pushed through that, and then I just got on with the job that needed to be done. And yeah, we went into gory and amusing details in that edition of 'Confess'."</p>
                    <p>Halford went on to say that cancer treatment has improved dramatically in recent years and that fewer patients die of cancer than ever before.</p>
                    <p>In July 2020, Rob underwent prostatectomy, an operation where the entire prostate gland is removed plus some of the tissue around it, including the seminal vesicles. After more cancer was found last year, he went through radiation treatments in April and May 2021 and eventually got then all-clear in June 2021. He also had an appendectomy after a tumor was discovered on his appendix.</p>
                    <p>"It's been a draining year, I can't deny it, but I'm delighted to have come through it," Halford wrote in the book. "I feel like I've had the most thorough MOT that a Metal God can have."</p>
                    <p>PRIEST guitarist Glenn Tipton was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease eight years ago — after being stricken by the condition at least half a decade earlier — but announced in early 2018 he was going to sit out touring activities in support of the band's latest album, "Firepower". He was replaced by "Firepower" producer Andy Sneap, who is also known for his work in NWOBHM revivalists HELL and cult thrash outfit SABBAT.</p>
                    <p>"Confess" was released in September 2020 via Hachette Books. It was written with Ian Gittins, co-writer of "The Heroin Diaries" by Nikki Sixx.</p>

                    <p>SCORPIONS singer Klaus Meine has opened up about his decision to alter some of the words in the band's anti-war anthem "Wind Of Change" order to appropriately reflect what's going on in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Meine and his bandmates wrote "Wind Of Change" after performing at 1989's Moscow Music Peace Festival in Moscow, where they shared the stage with other hard rock acts like BON JOVI and MÖTLEY CRÜE. The song was inspired by the sight of thousands of Russians cheering them on in 1988 — when they became the first hard rock band to play in Russia — and in 1989, at the aforementioned festival, even though they were a German band.</p>
                    <p>On March 26, at the opening concert of SCORPIONS' "Sin City Nights" residency at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino In Las Vegas, Nevada, Meine told the crowd before launching into "Wind Of Change": "This song is calling for peace, and tonight, I think, we shall sing it even louder. We dedicate this to the brave people in the Ukraine."</p>
                    <p>In a new interview with "Loudwire Nights" host Toni Gonzalez, Klaus explained the thought process behind changing the song's lyrics. "Before we came [to Las Vegas to begin the residency], I was thinking about how it feels to play 'Wind Of Change' the way we used to play for so many years, and I thought, it's not the time with this terrible war in Ukraine raging on, it's not the time to romanticize Russia with lyrics like, 'Follow the Moskva / Down to Gorky Park,' you know?" he said. "I wanted to make a statement in order to support Ukraine, and so the song starts now with, 'Now listen to my heart / It says Ukraine, waiting for the wind to change.'"</p>                          
                    <p>Back in 2015, SCORPIONS guitarist Rudolf Schenker stated about the inspiration for the original version of "Wind Of Change" "We wanted to show the people in Russia that here is a new generation of Germans growing up. They're not coming with tanks and guns and making war — they're coming with guitars and rock 'n' roll and bringing love!"</p>
                    <p>"There were so many emotional moments in Moscow," Meine added. "I guess it could have been BON JOVI or MÖTLEY CRÜE, any of these guys who had gone home inspired by what they saw, but for them it was like, 'Hey! We rocked the Soviet Union, dudes!' For us, maybe it was different. We saw so many changes from Leningrad in '88 to Moscow in '89. That was the inspiration for 'Wind Of Change'."</p>
                    <p>Last month, Meine told ABC Audio that fans could expect to see "a whole new production" during the Vegas residency, including a "new stage set" and an LED screen that will display "some cool scenes."</p>
                    <p>SCORPIONS previously played a Las Vegas mini-residency in May 2016, consisting of five shows at The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.</p>
                    <p>SCORPIONS' remaining Las Vegas shows are scheduled for April 12, 14 and 16. Afterwards they will cross the Atlantic to Europe where they will play six concerts in France and six shows in Germany supported by Wolfgang Van Halen's new band MAMMOTH WVH.</p>
                    <p>SCORPIONS' latest album, "Rock Believer", was released on February 25. The album was recorded primarily at Peppermint Park Studios in Hannover, Germany and was mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany with engineer Michael Ilbert, who has earned multiple Grammy nominations for his mix work with producer Max Martin on albums by Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.</p>
                    <p>SCORPIONS originally intended to record the new album in Los Angeles with producer Greg Fidelman, whose previous credits include SLIPKNOT and METALLICA. However, because of the pandemic, some of the initial work was done with Greg remotely, after which SCORPIONS opted to helm the recordings themselves with the help of their engineer Hans-Martin Buff.</p>
